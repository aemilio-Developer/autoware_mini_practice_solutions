Problem: The local planner stops at the last waypoint of the path, but the user-selected goal may not exactly match the last waypoint generated by the global planner. This causes confusion because the local planner only knows about the last waypoint, not the original goal point.

Implemented Solution:

After generating all waypoints along the full route (including those possibly extending beyond the goal), the last waypoint in the list is replaced with a new waypoint positioned exactly at the user-selected goal.

Specifically:
- The closest point to the goal on the path is calculated (via interpolation).
- A new waypoint is created at this exact location.
- The last waypoint of the path is overwritten with this new waypoint.

Why It Works:
- The published path contains all the original waypoints, but its last waypoint precisely coincides with the goal.
- Even if previous waypoints extend spatially beyond the goal, the visualized path line ends exactly at the last waypoint, which matches the goal.
- The local planner follows waypoints sequentially and stops at the last point, therefore stopping exactly at the goal location.
- By overwriting only the last waypoint, the path and the goal are perfectly synchronized, preventing stopping confusion.

The solution allows waypoints beyond the goal to remain in the list, but they do not affect final behavior because the path order and visualization depend on the sequence of waypoints and the position of the last point, which defines the effective end of the path.
