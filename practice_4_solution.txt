To resolve the consistency issue between the user-defined goal pose and the one displayed by the
global planner, so as to subsequently synchronize the local planner, idea 3 was followed: "create a new 
waypoint (the closest point on the path to the user-selected goal point) and use that as the path end 
and goal point."

In this way, by saving the coordinates of all waypoints and then creating the line onto which to project 
and interpolate the goal pose using the LineString object, the final waypoint was created and replaced 
the last element of the waypoint list, which was originally beyond the user-selected goal pose. 

By doing this, the path ends exactly around the chosen goal pose.
